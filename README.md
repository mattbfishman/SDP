# SDP
SDP stands for sequence distance problem. The code checks the mininmum distance it will take for two words to be the same. One word can either have a letter inserted, changed, or deleted. The code will change one of the words until it is equal and spit the distance between the words back at you. 
To run this code import the project into Eclipse and run the code with the public static void in it.
